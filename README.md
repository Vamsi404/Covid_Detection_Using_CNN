## 📋 Project Overview

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect COVID-19 infections from chest X-ray images. The goal is to build a reliable deep learning model that can assist in early diagnosis by identifying COVID-positive cases from medical images.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans, normalizes, and prepares X-ray images for training.
- **Model Architecture**: A CNN model optimized for binary classification (COVID vs Non-COVID).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score analysis.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays loss curves, confusion matrices, and more.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COVID-CNN-Detection.git
   cd COVID-CNN-Detection
   ```

2. **Set up the Environment:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Covid_detection_using_CNN.ipynb
   ```

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max pooling, dropout layers to reduce overfitting, and dense layers for classification. The final output is a binary classifier predicting COVID-19 presence.

## 📊 Results

- **Training Accuracy**: 95%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 92%
- **Confusion Matrix**: [Sample Confusion Matrix Image]

## 🔍 Data

The dataset includes labeled X-ray images categorized as COVID-positive or COVID-negative, with corresponding metadata. The images are preprocessed before feeding into the CNN.
